# eQTL Analysis
Here, I conducted a detailed analysis of expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) along with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to explore the genetic influences on gene expression. This multifaceted approach combined the precise identification of eQTLs with the broad overview provided by PCA, offering a comprehensive understanding of genetic regulation and variation.

Our eQTL analysis involved a methodical process where Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were stratified into groups, followed by linear regression for each SNP-gene pair. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of our findings, we applied a false discovery rate correction, addressing the multiple testing challenge. This rigorous approach led us to identify significant eQTLs, each revealing distinct relationships between SNPs and gene expression:

### eQTL 1: SNP 318
* Associated Genes: PDA21, LKJ65, and TXM58.
* Evidence and Findings: Positive linear associations indicated that there is an increase in gene expression with the non-reference alleles for these genes. This suggests that SNP 318 plays a significant role in regulating the expression of these genes.

### eQTL 2: SNP 222
* Associated Genes: MGK60, GWU22, and QIN15.
* Evidence and Findings: Negative linear associations were observed, showing that the presence of non-reference alleles is associated with decreased gene expression. This implies that SNP 222 acts as a regulatory element, potentially downregulating the expression of these genes.

### eQTL 3: SNP 94
* Associated Gene: GRC28.
* Evidence and Findings: A negative linear association was found, indicating less gene expression with non-reference alleles. This relationship points towards a potential regulatory influence of SNP 94 on GRC28 expression.


For each identified eQTL, the top significant associations were visualized, showcasing gene expression as a function of the SNP genotype. These visual representations not only corroborated the statistical findings but also provided a clear understanding of how genetic variations at the SNP level could influence gene expression patterns.
